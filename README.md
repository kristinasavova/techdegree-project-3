 The third Techdegree project

In this project, JavaScript is used to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I added my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by: adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity and validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
